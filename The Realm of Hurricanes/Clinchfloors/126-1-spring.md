I also notice I have no manager. I think Sarvesh died while hunting in the

### 15th Granite

My expedition leader is found dead in the dining hall. What in the hell is
happening. This fort must be haunted. Luckily Ushat is having a party to ligthen
spirits while we find someone else to take care of Ineth's duties.
