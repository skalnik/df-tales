# 1st Limestone, 125 - Autumn

The output liason Zefon Ragzaneg from Vathezzefon has arrived with some goods to
trade. Good thing we have nothing but rocks.

We have begun turning the meeting spot into a dining hall, however we need some
doors. A severe lack of doors recently.

Construction of the dormitory and personal bedrooms is also well underway

Some more migrants show up. Apparently a few trickled in earlier too that I
missed? Those lazy fucks.

Finally managed to trade for a barrel of beer and another pick, but I traded
before I had a screen shot.

Shallow metals may be lacking, but I have struck galena, which apparently smelts
to lead and silver, cha ching :moneybag: I hope theres more where this came from

I start clearing out stones but also changed tile sets.

Slava complains about lack of tables? I think we have some laying around, lets
spruce up the dining room! I also begin digging out more storage for metals.
Double checking that stockpile that was supposed to be for finished goods but is
empty.

Right as winter hits, I remember about the previously hit galena which I mined
a bit of! First step in Winter is to get metal industry working
